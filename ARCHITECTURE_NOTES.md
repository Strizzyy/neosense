    fetch_node_labels(),           # ~500ms
    fetch_relationship_types(),    # ~300ms  
    fetch_schema_info(),          # ~800ms
    fetch_quality_metrics(),      # ~1200ms (bottleneck)
    fetch_graph_stats(),          # ~400ms
    return_exceptions=True        # Graceful error handling
)
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Pro**: 75% performance improvement, better resource utilization
- ⚠️ **Con**: Increased complexity, requires careful error handling

# Secure credential flow: Frontend → API → Workflow → Activities
async def test_connection(credentials: dict):
    client = Neo4jClient(uri=uri, username=username, password=password)
    await client.load()  # Validates connection
    result = await client.run_query("RETURN 1 as test")
    await client.close()
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Pro**: Interactive demos, multi-user support, production flexibility

    initial_interval=timedelta(seconds=1),
    maximum_interval=timedelta(seconds=10),
    maximum_attempts=3,
    backoff_coefficient=2.0
)

# Partial failure handling
results = await asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True)
successful_results = [r for r in results if not isinstance(r, Exception)]
failed_activities = [r for r in results if isinstance(r, Exception)]
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Pro**: High reliability, graceful degradation, excellent debugging
- ⚠️ **Con**: Increased code complexity, additional error handling logic

### 5. **Async/Sync Bridge Pattern**

- **Future-Proofing**: Ready for Neo4j's upcoming async driver

**Implementation**:
```python
# Thread pool execution for sync operations
async def run_query(self, query: str, params: Optional[Dict] = None):
    def _run_query():
        with self.driver.session() as session:
            result = session.run(query, params or {})
            return [record.data() for record in result]
    
    # Execute sync operation in thread pool
    results = await asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor(None, _run_query)
    return results
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ **Pro**: Maintains async compatibility, non-blocking operations
- ⚠️ **Con**: Thread pool overhead, complexity in connection management

metadata_result = {
    "Schema Information": {      # Technical structure
        "node_labels": [...],
        "relationship_types": [...],
        "constraints": [...],
        "indexes": [...]
    },
    "Business Context": {        # Business intelligence
        "customer_segments": [...],
        "product_catalog": {...},
